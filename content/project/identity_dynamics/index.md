![Formspree Logo](formspree-logo.png)

## [Formspree](https://formspree.io) makes it easy to receive submissions from HTML forms on your static website.

### Functional Form

This theme has a **form-to-email** feature built in, thanks to the simple Formspree integration. All you need to activate the form is a valid recipient email address saved in the front matter of the form
(`/content/forms/contact.md`). Of course, the example shown below (`your@email.here`) must not be used. Please use your actual email address.
